# **An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R** Labs and Exercises in Python

The labs and exercises in the [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/index.html) book are originally presented using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). This repository is intended to provide the equivalent code in Python for the labs and exercises (my way of writing them).

## Installation

Code is in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). No other requirements are needed.

## Usage

Just run the scripts using your favorite IDE, or, on the command line, browse to the directory for a chapter, and run
```bash
python SCRIPT_NAME
```

The scripts actually contain Jupyter-like code cells, which can be interactively run inside Visual Studio Code with the appropriate setup. Refer to [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) for more information on how to do so. After setting up the environment, you can also [export a Jupyter notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support#_export-a-jupyter-notebook).
